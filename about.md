A curious odd guy with interests hanging in between music, human-computer interaction and machine learning. You can mostly find me cribbing about my summer internship at the verge of getting cancelled <span style="font-size:10px;">sssshhh, it's the virus</span>. Things I ❤️ include Jadavpur University, Python, my guitar, [puchka][puchka] & a nice silent walk in a breezy night.

### What's New

- Got an offer to work as Research Assistant this summer.
- SWE Intern at Doodl Space.
